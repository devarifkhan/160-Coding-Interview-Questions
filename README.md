- [Two Number Sum](#two-number-sum)


## Two Number Sum
> Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

> You can return the answer in any order.

>Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]

> Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

> Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?
